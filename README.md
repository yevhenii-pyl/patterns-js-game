## Naive console game implementation

Basically, we have a set of hardcoded events - battles for a player. 

If a player wins in a battle - he'll be asked if he wants to proceed or go home. 

In case a player survives all battles - game will be ended and player stats displayed. 

There is a room for growth with predefined Bag && Room classes.
